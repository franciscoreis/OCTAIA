# OCTAIA
Open Communication Standard Environment Proposal  

This is a project started 18th March 2020 to assist remote learning for schools.

It is currently being used in www.nogoclass.com and www.nogoparty.com which are supported on the same www.umniverse.com platform.

It has two mentors, Manuel Filipe Santos and Francisco Reis, who have a vision for a unified standard allowing different platforms to establish rich communication. 

The main goal is to address fragmentation where different platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Apple Facetime and Google Hangouts can not currently connect with each other.

Why the OCTAIA name? Because communication has many facets and we decided to highlight 8 (OCTo), one of which is intelligence (AIA - Artificial Intelligence Assistance). 

The 8 facets are Audio, Video, Text, Chat, Intelligence, Senses, Multiverse, Signs.

For this to happen, we must invest time in extracting the communication layer from the Umniverse platform so that any platform, including Umniverse, would access it in a standard and friendly way.

The final result would be a Javascript library that can easily be used by any platform. It will eventually be accompanied by a simple HTML file to demo its use.

For the time being, please tell us if this project would be interesting for you or your company so that we find motivation to commit an initial code version. 

Please, try the above links to NoGoClass and NoGoParty and give us your feedback. Thanks!

Note 1: Sincere thanks and due recognition to the open source library SimplePeer (https://github.com/feross/simple-peer) used by OCTAIA for WebRTC communication.
